TODO
1. Refactor
2. Make all the commands not start with the confirm but by reading the neccesary and then confirming each important step, like I did with nixos rebuild
3. Make a rclone section for sure and fast method to copy and synsc my stuff after changes after changes
4. Finish the help section (descriptions for menu commands)
