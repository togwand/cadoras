# cadoras
My shell command manager

#### TODO
1. Make all the commands not start with the confirm but by reading the neccesary and then confirming each important step, like I did with nixos rebuild
2. Make a rclone section for sure and fast method to copy and synsc my stuff after changes after changes
3. Finish the help section (descriptions for menu commands)
4. Make an actual derivation which is independent from my current system, adding build steps and dependencies
